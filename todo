CLASS
- Make subclass dropdown be locked until high enough level
- Make swapping between classes preserve level
- Race image import
- Fix Background roll tables, and make dice rollable
- fix starting equipment choices
- spell menu reacts on class change, creating error
- Create exportable .json with character build info
- Create a foundry dialog that json can be inputted into
- Create a foundry script that parses through the json and understands which sources are used, then builds the character
- Stop classes from sailing to the top of the list of selectable classes just because we applied some homebrew subclasses to it
- Make active buttons look prettier (right now they look bad because i had to fix a bug where they wouldnt show box shadow when active)
- Create a settings boolean that can toggle if switching away from a class that was part of the loaded save file will wipe all settings for that saved class (right now it doesnt, so if you load a ranger and change it to a rogue, it will keep proficiencies selected)
