CLASS
- Make subclass dropdown be locked until high enough level
- Make subclass change name of the "gain subclass" feature (Primal path for Barbarians)
- Make swapping between classes preserve level
- Add choices that appear lower down once high enough level is chosen
- Minimalize entire class choice page (useful when multiclassing)
