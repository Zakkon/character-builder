BUGS:
     
WEB:
    - Use mirror2's utils-dataloader.js instead (free sidedatainterface to another file)
    - Add UI notifications
    - Test custom urls for content (+ save/load/exportFvtt)
    - Test custom uploaded files for content (+ save/load/exportFvtt)

CSS:
    - Tidy up as much as possible into a single .css file
    - Rip some of the later css code from a .css file intended for use in foundry (i think it was style.css?)

SERIALIZIATION:
    - Make the cookies or character save file remember filter settings on each of the components?
    - Save json from uploaded homebrew files to a cookie

SHEET:
    - Ranged attacks
    - Cantrip attacks
    - Better attack parsing overall

CLASS:
    - Make subclass dropdown be locked until high enough level
    - Button for removing a class

EXPORT:
    - Include entities from uploaded homebrew files in export to FVTT
