- Race image import
- Fix Background roll tables, and make dice rollable
- fix starting equipment choices
- spell menu reacts on class change, creating error
- Create exportable .json with character build info
- Create a foundry dialog that json can be inputted into
- Create a foundry script that parses through the json and understands which sources are used, then builds the character
