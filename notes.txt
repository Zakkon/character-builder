HOW PFORMDATA IS CREATED
for(const _0x1862c4_ftoptsel of this['_compClass']['compsClassFeatureOptionsSelect'][_0x3b89aa_ix])
{
    //by converting it into a formdata, we get a lot of improvements. in all, it makes the feature readable and usable by foundry
    const _0x195903_ftoform=await _0x1862c4_ftoptsel['pGetFormData']()
    ....
}

---STATE---
this._state[propIxClass whatever] seems to not be set until we actually pick a class option in the dropdown
this happens in an eventlistener set by ComponentUIUtil.$getSelSearchable
that means its not set at all upon first load
